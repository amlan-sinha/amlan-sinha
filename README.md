# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amlan Sinha!

## About Me

[//]: # (Introduce yourself briefly. Mention your interests, professional background, or any personal projects you're passionate about.)

ðŸš€ About Me:
I am an aspiring Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, specializing in dynamical systems, control theory, and optimization. Currently, I am developing an algorithmic framework designed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of autonomous systems under operational uncertainty.

ðŸ’¡ Research & Experience:
My thesis centers on designing low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with robustness guarantees against partial engine failures, which has significant implications for space exploration and technology. 

I am proficient in C++, Python, and Matlab, and have a strong foundation in Dynamical Systems, Optimal Control Theory, and Optimization.
